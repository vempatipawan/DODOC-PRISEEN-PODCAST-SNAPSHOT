---

## COMPETITORS

| Competitor | Size/Stage | Key Difference |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Jellyfish | Enterprise, well-funded | CFO-oriented, budget forecasting |
| LinearB | 140 employees | DORA metrics, workflow automation |
| Waydev | Established | Cost-to-output analysis |
| Swarmia | Growing | Developer experience focus |
| Axify | Established | Value stream mapping |
| Haystack | Lighter | Simpler alternative |
| Pensero | Newer | Newer entrant |

---

## PAIN SIGNALS IDENTIFIED

1. **Services-to-product revenue transition** — Flatiron = consulting, Snapshot = SaaS. Two very different billing models under one roof.
2. **Multi-channel billing complexity** — Direct + AWS + Atlassian = 3 systems, 3 formats, zero reconciliation.
3. **No CFO/finance hire** — CEO + CTO + President only. No one dedicated to financial ops.
4. **Low marketplace traction** — 24 Atlassian installs. Need to optimize free→paid conversion.
5. **Pricing experimentation** — Per-seat, usage-based, free, custom — still searching for PMF in pricing.
6. **Pre-seed burn** — ~$120K funding, burning services revenue. Every dollar on tooling matters.

---

## NARRATIVE ANGLE SELECTION

### Primary: Draft 4 — THE MISSING DASHBOARD (5 signals)
- Pre-seed company → simple, universal value prop
- No billing tools visible → "imagine if you could see"
- No CFO → needs automated financial visibility
- Multiple pricing models → needs unified view
- Services-to-product → needs to separate revenue streams

### Secondary: Draft 3 — THE PRICING MIGRATION (2 signals)
- Multiple pricing models across channels
- Seat-based but experimenting with usage-based

---

## PERSONALIZATION APPLIED

### Language Swaps (Pre-Seed Tier)
| Default | Replaced With |
|---------|---------------|
| "board meeting" | "investor update" |
| "board report" | "financial snapshot" |
| Enterprise language | Removed |
| Scale examples | Smaller, relatable numbers |

### CTA Personalization
- **Primary Button:** "Book a Pilot with Snapshot AI's Data →"
- **Sub-CTA:** "Kırımgeray, we'll have Snapshot AI's dashboard ready before the call."
- **QR Instruction:** "This is Snapshot AI's dashboard. Not a demo. Scan."
- **Contact:** vijay@useunitpay.com | useunitpay.com

### Dashboard Numbers Used (Realistic Pre-Seed)
| KPI | Value | Context |
|-----|-------|---------|
| MRR | $8,740 | ~460 seats across channels |
| Net Margin | 72.3% | Software, low COGS |
| Channels | 3 Active | Direct, AWS, Atlassian |
| At-Risk | 2 | Customers with margin decline |

### Customer Table (Fictional but Realistic)
| Customer | Channel | MRR | Margin | Status |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|--------|
| TechCorp Inc | Direct | $2,280 | 78.4% | Healthy |
| DataFlow Labs | AWS | $1,710 | 64.2% | Watch |
| CodeSync | Atlassian→Direct | $380 | 81.2% | Healthy |
| ScaleOps | Direct | $1,900 | 71.8% | Healthy |
| NeuralDev | AWS | $2,470 | 42.1% | At Risk |
